Project Description
The LearnFast website serves as an online presence to introduce the Data Analytics course, provide detailed information, allow prospective students to register their interest, and offer general company information. It's structured to provide a clear and intuitive user experience.

Files Included
The project consists of five core HTML files, each representing a distinct step or section of the website:

index.html: The main landing page, introducing LearnFast and the Data Analytics course. It serves as the entry point for visitors.

course.html: Provides detailed information about the Data Analytics course curriculum, learning outcomes, and structure.

register.html: The application/registration form page where users can sign up for the course.

confirmation.html: A thank you page displayed after a user successfully submits the registration form.

about.html: A generic "About Us" and "Contact Us" page, providing company information and contact details.

How to Use
To view and interact with the website:

Download/Clone: Save all five HTML files to a single folder on your computer.

Open in Browser: Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Navigate: Use the navigation bar or call-to-action buttons to move between the different pages.

Note: Since this is a static website, the registration form (register.html) will redirect to confirmation.html upon submission, but the form data itself will not be processed or stored without a backend server.

User Journey
The website is designed to facilitate the following user flow:

Landing Page (index.html): User arrives and gets an overview of LearnFast and the Data Analytics course.

Course Details (course.html): User clicks on "Course" or a relevant call-to-action to learn more about the curriculum.

Registration (register.html): User decides to sign up and is directed to the registration form.

Confirmation (confirmation.html): After submitting the form, the user sees a thank you message.

About/Contact (about.html): User can visit this page at any time to learn more about LearnFast or get in touch.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content of each page.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling. It's loaded via a CDN.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Used for minor interactive elements, such as setting the current year in the footer.

Google Fonts (Inter): For consistent and modern typography.

Future Enhancements
Backend Integration: Implement a backend (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP) to process and store registration form submissions.

Form Validation: Add more robust client-side and server-side validation to the registration form.

Interactive Elements: Introduce more dynamic features, such as carousels for testimonials or interactive course outlines.

Analytics: Integrate web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to track user engagement.

SEO Optimization: Optimize meta tags, headings, and content for search engines.
